Inspired by link-based enhancements like <http://oembed.com> (via <http://css-tricks.com/oembed>) and responsive URLs/content like <http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/02/responsive-design-begins-with-the-url>
... it could be worth exploring patterns for other enhancements.

E.g.:

* An email address that turns into a vCard (perhaps on hover). Specifics could be controlled via data attributes
* Enhanced accordions (like the BBC stuff mentioned in the Smashing article) where by default a link to another list is shown, but JS (at suitable screen size) would use the link to make an Ajax request to fetch the full content as an accordion.
* Others?
