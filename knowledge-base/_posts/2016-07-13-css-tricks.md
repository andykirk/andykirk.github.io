I'm a big fan of [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) but that's not what this post is about.

I first start a real job as Web Developer in 2003. Back then the Web was very new, I was very new to Web Developement.
Recently I has cause to recall one of the very first CSS techniques I ever encountered. For me, it was the very first 'CSS trick' and gave me that "Ah ha!" moment when much of how CSS works clicked into place.
Out of sheer nostaligia I went looking for it. I'm pretty sure this is the article I saw all those years ago:
[Highlighting current page with CSS](http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/highlighting-current-page-with-css)

It's not a technique I'd employ or recommend any longer, but I'm happy it stil exists!
