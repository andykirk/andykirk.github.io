This tip from [Ahmad Shadeed](https://www.twitter.com/shadeed9) is interesting:

[CSS Writing Mode](https://ishadeed.com/article/css-writing-mode/)

In the past I've used CSS transforms to do this. I actually prefer the text to face the other direction, so maybe transforms would have to be used anyway.

For me, though having had a website with vertical (side-on) text for years, I've actually grown to dislike  it; I'm not sure why though.

Still, vertically stacking icons is a great use for it.
