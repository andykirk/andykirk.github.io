title: Magic randomisation with nth-child and Cicada Principle
tag: [CSS,Cicada Randomness]

I first heard about the Cidada principle on Sitepoint years ago: [The Cicada Principle and Why It Matters to Web Designers](https://www.sitepoint.com/the-cicada-principle-and-why-it-matters-to-web-designers/).
I was intrigued and I've tried using a couple of time to overlay background images to create the impression of randonmness.
It's very interesting and really nice to allow for some more organic variation, so I was quite pleased when it reared it's head again:

Using `nth-child` is a nice way of applying this. Great stuff!
