An interesting look at lazy loading images without breaking things if JS is unavailable:

[Lazy Loading Images? Donâ€™t Rely On JavaScript!](https://robinosborne.co.uk/2016/05/16/lazy-loading-images-dont-rely-on-javascript)

This is definitely in line with the [FallBack philosophy](http://fall-back.github.io/philistory/), so I'll definitely be thinking about including a reference there too.
