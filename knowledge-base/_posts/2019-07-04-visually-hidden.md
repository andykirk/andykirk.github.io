Final snippet:

~~~
.sr-only {
  border: 0 !important;
  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px) !important;
  -webkit-clip-path: inset(50%) !important;
          clip-path: inset(50%) !important;
  height: 1px !important;
  overflow: hidden !important;
  padding: 0 !important;
  position: absolute !important;
  width: 1px !important;
  white-space: nowrap !important;
}

.sr-only-focusable:focus,
.sr-only-focusable:active {
  clip: auto !important;
  -webkit-clip-path: none !important;
          clip-path: none !important;
  height: auto !important;
  overflow: visible !important;
  width: auto !important;
  white-space: normal !important;
}

I quite like using use HTML attributes rather than a class, though, especially for this sort of thing. Sanitizer CSS uses this:

```
[hidden][aria-hidden="false"]
```

However inside links, I noticed NVDA on Crome (at least) announces "link" at the start of each span. Some for example in a pagination link where "page" is visually-hidden and "1" is visible, NVDA announces "link page link 1". Annoying.

Plus, looking at MDN it seems pretty clear the Sanitizer approach is actually an abuse of those attributes.
